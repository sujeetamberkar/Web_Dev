# Intro
    - 1) Youtube Video: in chunks 
    - 2) Job of a devloper is to make it smooth for the user (User Experiece)
    - 3) Now a days there is almost no Buffering 

# Web Browser
    - 1) There are many web browser (G Chrome)
    - 2) In Linked- In, Instagram there is inbuilt web browser (To have a better user experiece)
    - 3) If you want to find the capacity of the web browser then go inspect 
        a) element : things used for coding 
        b) console
        c) source
        d) Network (How many request were done because of the request done by you to get the work done)
        e) Memory (Storage, cookies)
        f) Performance : Get performance of the entire webpage 
        g) Application
        h) Security
        i) Light House 

# Browser Engine
    - 1) Software in Web Browser 
    - 2) Initially we used to use HTML, CSS 
         We didnt require big power to run these code : (Render Engine)
    - 3) Now we got Java Script (Companies started to develop new software to run JS)
    - 4) V 8 Engine (Later developed as Node Js)
    So that the codes on the cient side can run properly 

# Static Website
    - 1) Content on static website do not change frequently (User Interaction ) with time 
    - 2) Static Website: Content is not genereated by the server (Logic)

    Eg: Twitter: (This is dynamic)
        Gym    : (Static)
        Resume : 

            - 1) HTML
            - 2) CSS
            - 3) Java Script

        If you want to make any changes in the website then you need to make changes in the code
        This is good only when you do not need to make frequent changes 
        (Good for showing your work)
        (Frequently asked question :)
        Gym (Services are given offline you just want to give information)
        Personal Blog 


        Limitations 
            We cannot use Static webiste for 
            a) Video Streaming: We need a backend to run video in different resolutions
            b) Social Meida 
            c) We need to change code every time we make changes 

        Not good for Interactions 
        Lack of flexibility 
        Limited Funcaionality 
        Not good for complex Implementatation 

        Advantage:
        Simplicity
        Speed
        Security
        Cost effectiveness
        Scalibility


# Dynamic Webiste
    - 1) Social Media Platform 
    - 2) Watch in lower Quality at low speed 
    - 3) Book My Show (Name of Movie keeps changing)
    - 4) E -Commerce: 
    - 5) Scalibility: Mannuaually control the scalibility
            a) On a Flight booking application:
                Flight will be searched a lot
                Booking will be comparitively less 

                Thus Search should be scalable 
                Searching request > Booking Request 


    Disadvantage:
        a) Not efficient for simple website 
        b) High Cost 
        c) Complex Model (Payment, if payment is deducted but booking failed)


# Client Server Architecture
     What is a client ? 
        - a) Where user interacts 
        - b) Zomato (User can decide what to order)
             Hot Star: U can watch IPL matches

        Device or software taat connect web server in order to be acessed
        Data is not feeded at client: It is fetched from the server 
     
     Command Prompt can be client
     Web Browser
     Application 

     What is a Server ? 
        Some segregation must be done in server to avoid delay 

        Database server
        Application Server : To set Application 
        Web Server : To fetch content from
